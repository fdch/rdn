\section{\texorpdfstring{\emph{CLOUD
RELATIONS}}{CLOUD RELATIONS}}\label{cloud-relations}

\emph{\textbf{For String Quartet with fixed Electroacoustic Stereo
Track.}}

\emph{Violin 1 and 2 should be placed on the two extremes of the stage,
with the Violoncello at the center and back of the stage. They remain
seated. Viola should be able to sit behind the audience, with enough
room to stand up and move around. Two speakers must be placed behind the
violins, and the stereo must be audible. The room should remain dark the
whole time, except for stopwatches that illuminate the players. If
stopwatches have no light, there should be individual, portable lights
facing each player. Relations last 15- 30 seconds long. The whole piece
should last around 13 minutes. The players -and not the electroacoustic
track- must end the piece. The overall dynamic of the piece is
\textbf{slow} and \textbf{quiet}.}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Each player has to play 9 (nine) sounds as \textbf{INITIATORS}, that
  may or may not cause the \textbf{Cloud Relations}:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    Players should use \emph{all} of the following techniques.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \item
      Sul tasto
    \item
      Sul pont
    \item
      Arco on the side of the instrument
    \item
      Flautato
    \item
      Col legno
    \item
      Pizzicato
    \item
      Tremolo (with arco or pizz.)
    \item
      Vibrato
    \item
      Adding \emph{noise} with air (with any vowel or with fricative
      consonants `f' or `s')
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    At least 3 of them should be \emph{combined} in any way:
  \item
    Players should use \emph{all} of the following pitches (in those
    registers, but in any string).

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \item
      At least 3 of them should be played in \emph{harmonics} (in
      \emph{any} register).
    \item
      Double strings may be used combining any of the pitches.
    \item
      The \emph{order should not be neither pre-established, nor the one
      expressed in the following fragments}:

      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumiv{\arabic{enumiv}.}
      \item
        Violin 1:
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\includegraphics[width=2.17323in,height=0.59055in]{media/image1.jpeg}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Violin 2:
\end{enumerate}

\includegraphics[width=2.17717in,height=0.59055in]{media/image2.jpeg}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Viola:
\end{enumerate}

\includegraphics[width=2.17323in,height=0.59055in]{media/image3.jpeg}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Violoncello:
\end{enumerate}

\includegraphics[width=2.17717in,height=0.59055in]{media/image4.jpeg}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Players should decide whether to \textbf{FOLLOW} another sound (from
  the other players or from the electroacoustic track) or \textbf{NOT TO
  FOLLOW}.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    When \emph{following}, the sound played can be \emph{any sound}
    except the pitches used as \emph{initiators}.
  \item
    The \emph{following} should be played with an idea of
    \emph{resonance} in mind, you can:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \item
      Extend
    \item
      Oppose
    \item
      Repeat
    \item
      Merge with the sound
    \item
      Any other resonance you can think of (with your instrument, body
      or any element)
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    \emph{Not following} can mean to:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \item
      Keep doing what you are doing
    \item
      Remain silent
    \item
      Initiate another sound.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{PARENTHESIS 1}: a \emph{parenthesis} has to be played after
  half the piece has passed.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    \textbf{Viola} should play the middle \textbf{D}, in
    \emph{\textbf{pppp}}, sul G, and with 30-90 seconds duration:
  \item
    Others have to:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \item
      Stop doing what they are doing when they realize this is
      happening.
    \item
      One player should play the same pitch.
    \item
      The two remaining players should each play an adjacent minor
      second: \textbf{Eb} and \textbf{Db}.
    \item
      Play in \emph{\textbf{pppp}}. Use any of the given techniques.
      Duration is determined by Viola.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Very important: Once you start a pitch, \emph{maintain} that pitch.
  Never adjust the tuning or suddenly change pitches if the pitch is not
  exact, or not a desired one.
\item
  The \textbf{ELECTROACOUSTIC STEREO TRACK} should be synchronized with
  the stopwatches so that everything starts at the same time, or within
  the same second.
\item
  Special indications for \textbf{VIOLA}:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    \emph{Three} chairs should be left empty behind the audience
    (center, left and right) for the player to sit and play and move
    freely between the three places.
  \item
    You can do any of the following actions at any time, but they should
    \emph{also} be performed at the given times. They should be
    performed very, very slowly and in the lowest audible dynamic:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \item
      A glass should be filled with water up to its half (3:15)
    \item
      A soda can should be opened (6:43)
    \item
      A chair should be pushed for 5-10 seconds (7:10)
    \item
      A plastic bag should sound for 10-25 seconds (8:00)
    \item
      \emph{One time only}: one action (of your choosing) to follow a
      sound from the electroacoustic stereo track.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    These actions can replace any of your initiators, \emph{but not the
    parenthesis}.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{ENDING}: Before the tape ends (11:00) -or if it already
  ended-, the players should start \textbf{PARENTHESIS 2}:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    The same as before but transposed in any interval;
  \item
    Any player except Viola should start. The others should follow,
    maintaining the previous relations.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Players should not use a score or any visual aid other than a
  stopwatch. They should try to remember what to do. However, it is ok
  if some things are forgotten, just \emph{keep on playing}.
\item
  These are \emph{not} rules, they are suggestions. Therefore,
  `cheating' does not apply; players or audiences may disagree, but they
  are still invited to \emph{keep on playing}.
\end{enumerate}
