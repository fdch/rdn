_CLOUD RELATIONS_


_FOR STRING QUARTET WITH FIXED ELECTROACOUSTIC STEREO TRACK._

_Violin 1 and 2 should be placed on the two extremes of the stage, with
the Violoncello at the center and back of the stage. They remain seated.
Viola should be able to sit behind the audience, with enough room to
stand up and move around. Two speakers must be placed behind the
violins, and the stereo must be audible. The room should remain dark the
whole time, except for stopwatches that illuminate the players. If
stopwatches have no light, there should be individual, portable lights
facing each player. Relations last 15- 30 seconds long. The whole piece
should last around 13 minutes. The players -and not the electroacoustic
track- must end the piece. The overall dynamic of the piece is SLOW and
QUIET._

1.  Each player has to play 9 (nine) sounds as INITIATORS, that may or
    may not cause the CLOUD RELATIONS:

    1.  Players should use _all_ of the following techniques.

        1.  Sul tasto

        2.  Sul pont

        3.  Arco on the side of the instrument

        4.  Flautato

        5.  Col legno

        6.  Pizzicato

        7.  Tremolo (with arco or pizz.)

        8.  Vibrato

        9.  Adding _noise_ with air (with any vowel or with fricative
            consonants ‘f’ or ‘s’)

    2.  At least 3 of them should be _combined_ in any way:

    3.  Players should use _all_ of the following pitches (in those
        registers, but in any string).

        1.  At least 3 of them should be played in _harmonics_ (in _any_
            register).

        2.  Double strings may be used combining any of the pitches.

        3.  The _order should not be neither pre-established, nor the
            one expressed in the following fragments_:

[]

1.  Players should decide whether to FOLLOW another sound (from the
    other players or from the electroacoustic track) or NOT TO FOLLOW.

    1.  When _following_, the sound played can be _any sound_ except the
        pitches used as _initiators_.

    2.  The _following_ should be played with an idea of _resonance_ in
        mind, you can:

        1.  Extend

        2.  Oppose

        3.  Repeat

        4.  Merge with the sound

        5.  Any other resonance you can think of (with your instrument,
            body or any element)

    3.  _Not following_ can mean to:

        1.  Keep doing what you are doing

        2.  Remain silent

        3.  Initiate another sound.

2.  PARENTHESIS 1: a _parenthesis_ has to be played after half the piece
    has passed.

    1.  VIOLA should play the middle D, in _PPPP_, sul G, and with 30-90
        seconds duration:

    2.  Others have to:

        1.  Stop doing what they are doing when they realize this is
            happening.

        2.  One player should play the same pitch.

        3.  The two remaining players should each play an adjacent minor
            second: EB and DB.

        4.  Play in _PPPP_. Use any of the given techniques. Duration is
            determined by Viola.

3.  Very important: Once you start a pitch, _maintain_ that pitch. Never
    adjust the tuning or suddenly change pitches if the pitch is not
    exact, or not a desired one.

4.  The ELECTROACOUSTIC STEREO TRACK should be synchronized with the
    stopwatches so that everything starts at the same time, or within
    the same second.

5.  Special indications for VIOLA:

    1.  _Three_ chairs should be left empty behind the audience (center,
        left and right) for the player to sit and play and move freely
        between the three places.

    2.  You can do any of the following actions at any time, but they
        should _also_ be performed at the given times. They should be
        performed very, very slowly and in the lowest audible dynamic:

        1.  A glass should be filled with water up to its half (3:15)

        2.  A soda can should be opened (6:43)

        3.  A chair should be pushed for 5-10 seconds (7:10)

        4.  A plastic bag should sound for 10-25 seconds (8:00)

        5.  _One time only_: one action (of your choosing) to follow a
            sound from the electroacoustic stereo track.

    3.  These actions can replace any of your initiators, _but not the
        parenthesis_.

6.  ENDING: Before the tape ends (11:00) -or if it already ended-, the
    players should start PARENTHESIS 2:

    1.  The same as before but transposed in any interval;

    2.  Any player except Viola should start. The others should follow,
        maintaining the previous relations.

7.  Players should not use a score or any visual aid other than a
    stopwatch. They should try to remember what to do. However, it is ok
    if some things are forgotten, just _keep on playing_.

8.  These are _not_ rules, they are suggestions. Therefore, ‘cheating’
    does not apply; players or audiences may disagree, but they are
    still invited to _keep on playing_.
